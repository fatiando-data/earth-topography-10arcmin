# Raw (original) data

Include here any original raw data that can't be downloaded directly by the
data preparation code.
Avoid doing this if at all possible.

To minimize the size of the repository, it's usually a good idea to compress
the data files if they aren't already.

The data file included is an LZMA compressed version of the ASCII grid exported
by ICGEM in their custom format.
